## 


Task management tools address a general need to organize, prioritize and visualize work. Through analysis, you learn how to get things done in more effective ways. Part of being organized includes setting priorities for tasks, visualizing the progress of tasks as they pass through stages of completion and compiling analysis or reports to direct future tasks and workflows.

When properly applied, task management tools can :point_down: :

 * <b>Manage and organize workloads: </b> Know what you have to do, and which items have priority. Assign and execute.
 * <b>Improve the quality of work:</b> Quality is never sacrificed for speed of production when tasks are organized, and information is correctly utilized.
 * <b>Drive collaboration: </b>Teams work better when there is a shared understanding of what needs to be done and ideas are easily communicated through a visual task management system.
 * <b>Reduce waste: </b>Eliminate time spent thinking of what to do next or reworking tasks that were not completed correctly on the first attempt.
 * <b>Meet deadlines: </b>With an organized task management system you and your team work more efficiently making missed deadlines a thing of the past.
